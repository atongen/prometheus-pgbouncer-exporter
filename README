# PgBouncer exporter for Prometheus

This is a simple exporter for PgBouncer that makes several metrics available to
Prometheus.

Metrics are exported from the SHOW LISTS, STATS, POOLS and DATABASES command
output. For the full list, see the prometheus_pgbouncer_exporter/collectors.py
file.

## Installation

### Debian

You can build a Debian binary package from the source package in the git
repository. Alternatively, you can download a binary package from here:

  http://cbaines.net/projects/prometheus-pgbouncer-exporter/releases/

### Other Operating Systems

I would recommend installing using setuptools, then running the
promtheus-pgbouncer-exporter script. A systemd service file is provided which
can be used if you have systemd.
